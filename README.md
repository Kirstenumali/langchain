# LangChain
According to **LangChain**, LangChain is a framework to build with LLMs by chaining interoperable components. LangGraph is the framework for building controllable agentic workflows. For example, ChatGPT or OpenAI was used. Overall, LangChain is used for LLM. 

According to **Nallagoni Omkar**, LangChain is a Python framework or JavaScript framework used to integrate with large language models (LLM). Langchain is a framework. LangChain creates the GeminiAI prompt. 

## Real World Models in LangChain
1) ChatGPT - OpenAI + Microsoft  
2) GeminiAI - Google 
3) BedRock - Amazon 
4) Llama - Meta

## Lifecycle of a Data Science 
1. Read the data or Gather the data
2. Preprocess the data
3. Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Model Development
     - Machine Learning (Scikit-learn)
     - Deep Learning (TensorFlow/Pytorch/Keras)
     - Natural Language Process (NLTK)
     - GenAI + LLM (LangChain)
5. Model Evaluation
6. Hyperparameter Tuning
7. Model Deployment
  - Azure AI Certification is included in this process.  

## LLM Processor
A) Chains 

B) Agents 

C) Tools 

D) Memory 

E) Callbacks 

## The LangChain UseCase, we are going to check: 
## Definition: 
ChatBot uses an LLM Model, so you must write some Python code.

## Chatbot Questions: 
1. Who is the president of the United Arab Emirates?
Bot: Mohammad Bin Zayed Al Nayan
2. Which party does he belong to?
Bot: Chains


## RAG Framework 
## Definition 
Retirival Augmented Generation 
- For instance, you are working for a healthcare company.
- Domain related: Budget
- You will ask a question: what is the budget? (LLM)
    - It will search from the document.
    - It will give you the answer.
